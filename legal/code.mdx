title: Code policy
---

ask manu (“askmanu”) recognizes that its customers' code is their proprietary intellectual property, which could cause significant harm to their business if made public or shared with unauthorized parties. Accordingly, this Code Policy sets forth the steps taken by askmanu to safeguard the confidentiality of the code that is sent to askmanu's servers in the course of using askmanu's products and services (the “Code Data”).

This policy refers specifically to the code that is uploaded to askmanu servers by allowing the service access to code hosting providers (like github). Other user data, including but not limited to customer emails, phone numbers, IP addresses, analytics data relating to use of the [askmanu.co](https://askmanu.co) website, or general metadata collected about customers’ usage and traffic patterns, is governed by the Privacy Policy, not the Code Policy.

If you use the products offered by askmanu, the code you upload, paste in or allow access to will be sent to a third-party model provider such as OpenAI or Anthropic based on the use case. The handling of your data by model providers is subject to their own policies, which may change at any time.

1. All Code Data is saved using Google Cloud products using EU based servers. A list of all third party infrastructure providers who may have the ability to access Code Data is available to customers upon request.
2. All Code Data is permanently deleted on account deletion or on request.
3. askmanu does not use Code Data to develop its products and services.
4. askmanu does not share Code Data with any third parties except as required by law or as necessary to provide its products and services.

askmanu reserves the right to modify this Code Policy at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
